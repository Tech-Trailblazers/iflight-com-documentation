GPS:
Our Nazgul F5 series comes in two versions. If you installed a GPS module or used the pre-installed GPS module, please select accordingly.
For safety reasons GPS Resuce is NOT active on default! We've included a card in the Box (for all GPS models) to explain some options.

Custom Firmware (for HD version only):
Betaflight Custom version with OSD Warnings on the DJI Goggle (BNF stock Firmware)
The official Betaflight release does not support the Betaflight Warnings on the OSD.
There's a modified custom release we use for our stock BNFs, as there is many advantages in seeing what's going on with your flight controller.
Warnings are show as "Craft_Name", this cell was used as a workaround to display if "RX_LOSS", "GPS Rescue" or other status messages.
Please flash the custom *.hex included in this folder (HD version only, Analog does display ALL OSD elements)!

Please make sure you know what you're doing and check following article for further clarification on how to use our factory dump files!
